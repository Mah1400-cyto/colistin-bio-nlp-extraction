# Colistin BioNLP Extraction

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based pipeline for extracting resistance genes and related antibiotics from scientific articles on *Klebsiella pneumoniae* resistance to **Colistin**.

## 🔬 Project Goal
To identify and organize molecular biomarkers (genes, resistance mechanisms, and antibiotics) mentioned in biomedical literature using Python and AI tools.

## 📁 Repository Content
- `colistin_extraction.ipynb`: Python notebook for article processing and data extraction
- `output_colistin.csv`: Final table with extracted genes, antibiotics, and related data
- `Project_Description.docx`: A brief Word file explaining project steps in English

## 📊 Output Example
| Article Title | Resistance Gene | Related Antibiotic |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Title 1       | mcr-1            | Colistin            |
| Title 2       | mgrB             | Colistin            |
